          <div class="body-text">Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Our task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.</div>

They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and theyâ€™re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.</div>

Then I made the data sets more consistent and accurate by data cleaning. After that, I combined all the different datasets and produced the final dataset. Thus, I employed methods such as deriving new columns, aggregating and visualizing data to answer key questions.</span>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">This was my first coding project. I have enjoyed tackling Python and working with large data sets. I also quickly became familiar with using Juypter notebook. But as always, analyzing data is always open to surprises, and the same thing didn't change in this case. For example, while exploring the data by creating visuals such as histograms and scatterplots, I discovered that there are outliers such as $10.000, $20.000 in the prices column. I thought that this must be the result of data corruption or some kind of special value within the data. Since it would not make sense to sell such high priced products in the online grocery market, I labelled values over $100 as missing in order to conduct an accurate and consistent analysis. However, this operation should be done during the data cleaning process. So, since I have a well organized notebook, I added this to the previous step and ran the updated script.</div>
